#### Develop Locally

You would need `pnpm@7.14.2` in order to bootstrap and test a local copy of this repo.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/vibrantX-finance/yield-fe.git`
2. On the root folder, run `pnpm install` and `pnpm turbo run build`
3. On the root folder, run `pnpm turbo run dev` - that would spin up a local server (`http://localhost:5173/`) with the `vite + ReactJS` app
